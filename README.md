# Expense Tracker Web Application


The **Expense Tracker** is a simple web-based application that helps users track their expenses and manage their budgets. The application allows users to log their expenses, view the total amount spent, and even clear their expense history. It supports multiple currencies and provides an option to choose the currency for accurate tracking of expenses.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It stores the user's data locally using the browser's `localStorage`, so the expenses persist across sessions.

- **Add Expenses:** Users can add descriptions and amounts of their expenses.
- **Currency Selector:** Users can choose the currency to display their expenses.
- **Clear Expenses:** Users can clear their entire list of expenses at any time.
- **Total Expense Calculation:** The app automatically calculates and displays the total amount spent by the user.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, making it accessible on mobile devices as well.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the pages and forms.
- **CSS3**: For styling the pages and making the application responsive.
